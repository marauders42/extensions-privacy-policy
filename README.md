Extensions Privacy Policy

Revision: 8/29/2023

No extensions that I write collect any data from the user. Therefore the user's data cannot be sold to third parties. If changes are made to this privacy policy, I will update my extensions and require the user to accept the updated privacy policy before proceeding. For any questions or concerns please file an issue with this repository or email me at the email address listed on my Chrome Web Store account.
